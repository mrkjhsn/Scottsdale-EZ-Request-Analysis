# Scottsdale-EZ-Request-Analysis

Dataset contains requests for service made by citizens.  It includes information such as the issue (No water, Sewer Backup, ect.) as well as the location of the request, as well as the open and close date of the request.  Below is the link where citizens can submit requests.

A few things I'm interested in exploring with this dataset:
1. trends in specific types of requests
1. relationship between complaints and weather characteristics
1. length of time complaint is open
